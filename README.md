# rape-mugging-alarm-raspberrypi
I am making a low-cost safety alarm from a Raspberry Pi Zero.

This is inspired by a recent interest in Raspberry Pis and ring wearables, such as the beautiful yet exorbitantly priced Siren.

## Materials List
- GPS module
stuff

## Current planned functionalities
- Silent Alarm to discreetly text family, friends, and/or local police. 
  There will be multiple levels to this, like a yellow alarm "I feel nervous, this is my location."
  or "I feel nervous, call me." and a red alarm "Call the police, I'm in danger" with a location sent.
- Very loud whistle sound.

## Things I'm thinking through
- I want to make this system easy to carry around and hide on someone's person. 
I think this will change depending on who's using it e.g. a man, a woman, an elderly person, a child, a middle of the road aged person,
a person of color who might get trigger shot if they reach into their clothes.
- I want to make this system self-sustaining or low maintenance power wise.
- I may want to integrate the Raspberry Pi into a wearable.

## Advantages of this type of system:
- It is less steps than navigating through a smart phone - this saved time can be life saving.
- It should be low cost.
- It's fun to make and share if you are an open source/DIY enthusiast. It is made for minorities especially in mind, so there's an added bonus of 
  supporting diversity in the maker community.
- It does not stop working if your phone is taken or has run out of charge.
- It is not tied to an app store or phone functionalities.
